Advanced Custom Fields: Options Page Adder
==========================================

Allows easy creation of options pages using Advanced Custom Fields Pro needing to do any PHP coding.

**Requires that ACF5 Pro is installed.**

Please see readme.txt for more information

**For anyone that's following this, or using it. I have removed support for ACF 4. I have also corrected a slug error that makes it not backwards compatible with any previous version. Updating to version 2.0.0 will likely mean that any ACF field groups you had associated with options pages will no longer be associated with them and you will need to go into your field groups and reset the location rules.**
